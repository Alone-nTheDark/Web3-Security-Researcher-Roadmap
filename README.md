2. Watch all of the [playlists](https://www.youtube.com/@smartcontractprogrammer/playlists) by [Smart Contract Programmer](https://www.youtube.com/@smartcontractprogrammer)
3. Complete all of the courses in [Cyfrin Updraft](https://updraft.cyfrin.io)
4. Complete the [Secureum Mindmap](https://github.com/x676f64/secureum-mind_map)
5. Watch [Owen Thurm](https://www.youtube.com/@0xOwenThurm) on YouTube ([Web3 Security 101 playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIoozgIl4pw&list=PLTJasqY2MI_8XWRY3Ovw39DEkunIyPJUt), [Advanced Web3 Security Course Part 1 & Part 2](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWdUkQu4ts19wkfWmoT7NkB2l3M03P1r3&si=NX1Divi1Jukhnmjg))
7. Exercise most common smart contract vulnerabilities with the [DeFiVulnLabs](https://github.com/SunWeb3Sec/DeFiVulnLabs) repository
8. Reproduce DeFi hack incidents with the [DeFiHackLabs](https://github.com/SunWeb3Sec/DeFiHackLabs) repository
8. Do at least 2-3 shadow audits (Redo past contests, which already have final reports out, start with [BeedleFi](https://www.codehawks.com/contests/clkbo1fa20009jr08nyyf9wbx) on CodeHawks and [Asymmetry](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-asymmetry) on Code4rena), and also participate in [First Flights](https://www.codehawks.com/first-flights) by [Cyfrin](https://www.cyfrin.io)
9. Learn bugs from the audits in [Solodit](https://solodit.xyz/)

Now you should be ready to participate in live contests on audit platforms like [Code4rena](https://www.code4rena.com), [Sherlock](https://audits.sherlock.xyz/), [CodeHawks](https://www.codehawks.com), [Cantina](https://www.cantina.xyz), [HatsFinance](https://app.hats.finance) and [Immunefi](https://immunefi.com/bug-bounty/). Before participating in a public contest, be sure to read the documentation of the audit platform that organizes it!
